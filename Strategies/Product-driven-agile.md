# ContractClarity Project Structure

# Product-Driven Agile Framework

This framework implements a hierarchical work organization approach that addresses common scaling challenges in rapidly growing development teams. It provides a structured solution for organizations experiencing:

- Communication breakdowns as teams expand from small groups to dozens of members
- Inconsistent development practices due to poorly defined SDLC processes
- Quality issues stemming from inadequate testing procedures
- Limited project visibility caused by fragmented planning and reporting systems

The approach outlined here has proven effective across multiple organizations by creating:
1. A project management framework
2. A knowledge repository

It goes beyond mere alignment with Azure DevOps best practices.
Instead, it fosters a shared mental model across the organization.

This approach offers several benefits:
- Accelerates onboarding
- Enhances cross-team understanding
- Establishes a unified product vision

New team members can quickly comprehend:
- The "what" of the project
- The "why" behind decisions
- How it connects to broader objectives

As a living document, this structure evolves alongside the product.
This ensures all stakeholders maintain a consistent understanding of:
- Priorities
- Dependencies
- The overall product roadmap

## Key Demonstrations

- Team ownership of specific areas (e.g., X-Force with Contract Explorer)
- Shared service teams supporting product teams (e.g., DART supporting X-Force on AI features)
- Platform dependencies (Node upgrade affects all teams)
- Release planning (tasks show sequence and dependencies)
- Cross-team collaboration (shared ownership of features)

## Key Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clear Team Ownership**:
   - Product teams (Blue Fusion, Transformers, etc.) can own specific product areas like Analytics or Contracts
   - Shared service teams align naturally:
     - Ninjas (DevOps) can own deployment pipelines across all areas
     - Zamboni Mafia (Platform Architecture) can own Platform Infrastructure
     - DART (Data & AI) can support Analytics and data processing capabilities

2. **Workflow Demonstration**: Shows how features flow from ideas through development and testing:
   - Example: Contract Explorer feature would move through requirements, development, testing, and deployment
   - Shows integration points between teams (e.g., when DART needs to support a new analytics capability)

3. **Clear Reporting Structure**: Enables leadership to see:
   - Which teams own which product areas
   - What features are in progress across the platform
   - Release timelines and dependencies
   - Quality metrics by team and product area

4. **Scalable Framework**: As the organization grows, this structure:
   - Supports adding new teams with clear responsibilities
   - Maintains visibility into cross-team dependencies
   - Enables proper planning and resource allocation

## Work Item Structure

ContractClarity's work item structure is designed to align with Azure DevOps best practices while providing a clear, hierarchical organization of project elements. This structure offers significant benefits for project management and team coordination:

1. Clarity of Ownership: Each work item level has clear ownership, from epics owned by leadership to tasks assigned to individual team members.
2. Traceability: The hierarchy allows easy tracing from high-level business objectives down to specific implementation tasks.
3. Flexibility: The structure adapts to various project sizes and complexities, accommodating both large initiatives and smaller enhancements.
4. Cross-team Collaboration: By clearly defining dependencies and support roles, the structure facilitates smoother inter-team cooperation.
5. Progress Tracking: Leadership can easily gauge progress at various levels, from overall epics to individual features and tasks.

This structured approach to work items enhances project visibility, streamlines planning processes, and ultimately contributes to more efficient and effective project delivery.

### Work Item Pyramid

                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │    EPICS    │ Strategic initiatives (3-6 months)
                    └─────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
                ┌─────────────────────┐
                │      FEATURES       │ Functional capabilities (1-2 quarters)
                └─────────────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
        ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
        │           USER STORIES            │ End-user value (1 sprint)
        └───────────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                 TASKS                     │ Development activities (1-3 days)
    └───────────────────────────────────────────┘

Each layer in this pyramid serves a distinct purpose:

- **Epics** translate business vision into actionable initiatives
- **Features** break down initiatives into tangible product enhancements
- **User Stories** capture the "who, what, why" of user-centered functionality
- **Tasks** define the concrete steps needed to deliver value

This pyramid structure ensures that every development activity connects directly to strategic objectives, maintaining alignment from executive vision to code implementation.

### Work Item Lifecycle

The ContractClarity work items follow a structured lifecycle that integrates with Azure DevOps while maintaining flexibility for teams:

#### Planning Phase
- **Quarterly Planning**: Epics are created or refined during quarterly planning sessions
- **Sprint Planning**: Features and User Stories are prioritized and assigned to upcoming sprints
- **Refinement**: Teams conduct regular backlog refinement to ensure User Stories are ready for implementation

#### Implementation Phase
- **Sprint Execution**: Tasks are created, assigned, and tracked during sprint execution
- **Daily Updates**: Team members update task status daily, enabling real-time progress tracking
- **Cross-team Coordination**: Dependencies between teams are managed through linked work items

#### Review Phase
- **Acceptance**: Completed work items undergo review against defined acceptance criteria
- **Demo**: Implemented features are demonstrated in sprint reviews
- **Retrospective**: Work item processes are evaluated and improved during sprint retrospectives

This lifecycle ensures that work items not only track progress but also facilitate communication, coordination, and continuous improvement across the organization.

### Work Item Creation Guidelines

#### Epics
- Should address a significant business objective
- Typically span 3-6 months of work
- Owned by a specific team lead or product owner
- Example: "Platform Modernization"

#### Features
- Represent distinct, valuable functionality
- Should be completable within 1-2 quarters
- Must have a clear owner and may have supporting teams
- Example: "AI-Powered Contract Analysis"

#### User Stories
- Follow the format: "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
- Should be estimable, testable, and deliverable within a sprint
- Focus on user value rather than technical implementation
- Example: "As a procurement manager, I want to automatically extract key terms from uploaded contracts"

#### Tasks
- Represent specific technical activities
- Typically assigned to individual team members
- Should be completable in 1-3 days
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Example: "Design ML model for term extraction"

### Best Practices

- Maintain consistent naming conventions for `short_desc` fields
- Ensure each work item has a clear owner
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- Update status regularly to maintain accurate project visibility
- Use the relationship fields to maintain proper hierarchy
