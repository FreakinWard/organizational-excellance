# Agile Team Roles and Expectations

## Introduction

This guide defines the core roles, responsibilities, and expectations for our agile teams. As we continue to evolve our product development culture, it's essential that all team members understand both their individual contributions and how we function collectively as a high-performing organization.

Building great products requires a strong partnership between business and technology, with clear expectations and shared accountability. This guide establishes the foundation for that partnership, enabling us to deliver value to our customers consistently, predictably, and sustainably.

By aligning on these principles, we create an environment where innovation thrives, quality is inherent, and we can respond quickly to market and customer needs. These practices aren't just about efficiencyâ€”they're about creating a fulfilling work environment where teams are empowered to do their best work.

## Core Agile Principles

Our teams operate according to these key agile principles:

1. **Delivering Value Early and Often**: We prioritize working software over comprehensive documentation.
2. **Embracing Change**: We adapt to changing requirements, even late in development.
3. **Sustainable Development**: We maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
4. **Technical Excellence**: We pay continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
5. **Simplicity**: We maximize the amount of work not done.
6. **Self-Organization**: The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
7. **Regular Reflection**: We reflect on how to become more effective, then adjust our behavior accordingly.

## Team Structure and Roles

### Shared Responsibilities
All team members, regardless of role, share these fundamental responsibilities:

- **Deliver Value**: Focus on creating outcomes that matter to customers and the business
- **Collaborate**: Work together effectively across roles and disciplines

### Shared Behaviors
These behaviors create the foundation for high-performing teams:

- **Transparency**: Make work visible and discuss challenges openly

## Work Item Management

### Backlog Refinement

- Ensure items are clearly defined with acceptance criteria
- Break down large items into manageable pieces
- Identify and document dependencies between items
- Estimate complexity to aid in sprint planning
- Prioritize items based on business value and technical considerations

### Definition of Ready

An item is ready for development when:
- The acceptance criteria are clear and testable
- Dependencies are identified to prevent unexpected blockers
- The team has sufficient information to estimate the work accurately
- The item has been prioritized by the Product Owner to align with business goals
- The item is sized appropriately to be completed within a single sprint

### Definition of Done

An item is considered done when:
- All acceptance criteria have been met
- Code has been reviewed by at least one other developer
- Automated tests have been written and are passing
- The code has been merged to the main branch
- Documentation has been updated as needed
- The Product Owner has accepted the implementation

### Core Ceremonies

**Daily Standup**
- Limit to 15 minutes to respect everyone's time
- Share completed work, planned work, and blockers to coordinate daily activity
- Focus on progress toward sprint goals rather than status reporting
- Identify blockers that require immediate attention
- Defer detailed discussions to follow-up conversations

**Sprint Planning**
- Review sprint goals to ensure alignment with business objectives
- Select items from the refined backlog to include in the sprint
- Break down items into tasks to increase visibility into the work
- Estimate effort to ensure the sprint is realistically scoped
- Commit as a team to the sprint backlog to foster shared ownership

**Sprint Review**
- Demonstrate completed work to gather feedback from stakeholders
- Focus on business outcomes rather than technical implementation
- Gather feedback to inform future work and prioritization
- Celebrate achievements to build team morale
- Update the product backlog based on new insights

**Sprint Retrospective**
- Reflect on team processes to identify improvements
- Discuss what went well to reinforce positive patterns
- Address what could be improved to eliminate impediments
- Create actionable improvements for the next sprint

**Three Amigos**
- Bring together development, testing, and business perspectives to ensure comprehensive understanding
- Clarify requirements before development begins to prevent rework
- Identify edge cases early to improve solution quality
- Document decisions to maintain shared understanding

## Engineering Practices
