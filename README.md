# Overview

Scope and context: This project demonstrates effective software project organization techniques to address scaling challenges in rapidly growing development teams. It provides a structured framework that can evolve with organizational growth.

Problem: The organization is experiencing side effects of the following compounding problems: 
1. Rapid team growth (from 5 to 30 members) creating coordination and communication challenges
2. Inconsistent development practices due to loosely defined and enforced SDLC processes
3. Quality assurance bottlenecks due to heavy reliance on manual testing, with opportunity to implement automated testing practices
4. Fragmented project visibility due to lack of centralized reporting and planning systems

Strategy: This project implements a structured work organization approach using Azure DevOps as the demonstration platform. It follows industry best practices to organize work hierarchically through Epics, Features, User Stories, and Tasks, aligned with distinct product areas.

# Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clear Team Ownership**:
   - Product teams (Blue Fusion, Transformers, etc.) can own specific product areas like Analytics or Contracts
   - Shared service teams align naturally:
     - Ninjas (DevOps) can own deployment pipelines across all areas
     - Zamboni Mafia (Platform Architecture) can own Platform Infrastructure
     - DART (Data & AI) can support Analytics and data processing capabilities

2. **Workflow Demonstration**: Shows how features flow from ideas through development and testing:
   - Example: Contract Explorer feature would move through requirements, development, testing, and deployment
   - Shows integration points between teams (e.g., when DART needs to support a new analytics capability)

3. **Clear Reporting Structure**: Enables leadership to see:
   - Which teams own which product areas
   - What features are in progress across the platform
   - Release timelines and dependencies
   - Quality metrics by team and product area

4. **Scalable Framework**: As the organization grows, this structure:
   - Supports adding new teams with clear responsibilities
   - Maintains visibility into cross-team dependencies
   - Enables proper planning and resource allocation

## Sprints

The project implements a standardized bi-weekly sprint schedule aligned with quarterly planning cycles. All teams operate on this synchronized cadence to facilitate coordination and consistent delivery. Sprints follow a sequential numbering convention (Sprint 01-16) that resets annually, providing clear temporal context for planning and reporting:

- Quarter 01
    - Sprint 01
    - Sprint 02
    - Sprint 03
    - Sprint 04
- Quarter 02
    - Sprint 05
    - Sprint 06
    - Sprint 07
    - Sprint 08
- Quarter 03
    - Sprint 09
    - Sprint 10
    - Sprint 11
    - Sprint 12
- Quarter 04
    - Sprint 13
    - Sprint 14
