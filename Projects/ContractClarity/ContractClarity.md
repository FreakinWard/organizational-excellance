# ContractClarity Project Structure

The ContractClarity project employs a hierarchical work item structure and adheres to the [Product-driven Agile](../Implementations/Product-driven-agile.md) methodology.

This structure serves dual purposes:
1. A project management framework
2. A knowledge repository

It goes beyond mere alignment with Azure DevOps best practices.Instead, it fosters a shared mental model across the organization.

This approach offers several benefits:
- Accelerates onboarding
- Enhances cross-team understanding
- Establishes a unified product vision

New team members can quickly comprehend:
- The "what" of the project
- The "why" behind decisions
- How it connects to broader objectives

As a living document, this structure evolves alongside the product.
This ensures all stakeholders maintain a consistent understanding of:
- Priorities
- Dependencies
- The overall product roadmap

## Key Demonstrations

- Team ownership of specific areas (e.g., Z-Squad with Contract Explorer)
- Shared service teams supporting product teams (e.g., JAVELIN supporting Z-Squad on AI features)
- Platform dependencies (Node upgrade affects all teams)
- Release planning (tasks show sequence and dependencies)
- Cross-team collaboration (shared ownership of features)

## Teams

Each team will need to own an area of the product. However, teams that serve as shared services may need to own multiple areas as a result of supporting multiple areas of the product

- Cobalt Coalition - This team focuses on product platform, without an assigned area
- Metamorphs - This team focuses on product platform, without an assigned area
- Esc-Tab-Prime - This team focuses on product platform, without an assigned area
- QRTZ - This team focuses on product platform, without an assigned area
- Covert Command - This team focuses on product platform, without an assigned area
- Z-Squad - This team focuses on product platform, without an assigned area
- Samurai - This team focuses on DevOps and serves as a shared service to support the Product Teams
- Ice Cartel - This team focuses on Platform Architecture and serves as a shared service to support the Product Teams
- JAVELIN - This team focuses on Data & AI, Research & Tooling and serves as a shared service to support the Product Teams

## Work Items

The ContractClarity project employs a hierarchical work item structure that serves as both a project management framework and a knowledge repository. This structure provides:

- Clear ownership and accountability
- Traceability from strategic objectives to implementation tasks
- Consistent organization across teams
- Preserved institutional knowledge
