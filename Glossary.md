# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout this repository. Use it as a reference to ensure clear communication and understanding of the methodologies and frameworks presented.

## Work Item Terminology

### Epic
A large body of work that represents a significant business initiative or strategic objective. Epics typically span multiple quarters and are broken down into features.

**Example:** Platform Modernization, Contract Management Enhancement

### Feature
A specific capability or functionality that delivers value to users. Features are components of epics and are typically completed within 1-2 quarters.

**Example:** AI-Powered Contract Analysis, Custom Reporting Engine

### User Story
A description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. User stories follow the format: "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]" and are typically completed within a single sprint.

**Example:** "As a procurement manager, I want to automatically extract key terms from uploaded contracts"

### Task
A specific technical activity required to implement a user story. Tasks are assigned to individual team members and typically take 1-3 days to complete.

**Example:** "Design machine learning model for term extraction"

## Team Structure Concepts

### Product Team
A cross-functional team responsible for delivering features within a specific product area. Product teams typically include developers, testers, and sometimes designers or product managers.

**Example:** Z-Squad, Cobalt Coalition

### Shared Service Team
A specialized team that provides support and expertise across multiple product areas. Shared service teams typically focus on specific technical domains.

**Example:** Ice Cartel (Platform Architecture), JAVELIN (Data & AI)

### Product Area
A distinct functional domain within the overall product. Product areas are typically aligned with user-facing capabilities.

**Example:** Analytics, Contracts Management, Supplier Management

## Process Terminology

### Sprint
A fixed time period (typically 2 weeks) during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. All teams operate on the same sprint schedule to facilitate coordination.

**Example:** Sprint 01, Sprint 02

### Sprint Planning
A meeting at the beginning of each sprint where the team selects user stories from the backlog to work on during the sprint, based on priority and capacity.

### Daily Standup
A brief daily meeting where team members share what they worked on yesterday, what they'll work on today, and any blockers they're facing.

### Sprint Review
A meeting at the end of each sprint where the team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback.

### Sprint Retrospective
A meeting at the end of each sprint where the team reflects on what went well, what could be improved, and actions to take in the next sprint.

### Backlog Refinement
The ongoing process of reviewing and updating the product backlog to ensure user stories are appropriately prioritized and ready for implementation.

### Bug
An indicator of a process failure in the software delivery lifecycle. While manifesting as a defect or unexpected behavior in the product, bugs represent opportunities to improve the entire development process—from requirements gathering and design to implementation, testing, and deployment. Rather than just symptoms to fix, bugs should be viewed as valuable feedback that helps teams strengthen their overall delivery system.

**Example:** A missing validation check might indicate gaps in requirements gathering; a performance issue might reveal insufficient testing scenarios; recurring similar defects might suggest needed improvements in code review practices.

### Silo
An organizational structure or mindset where teams or departments operate in isolation with limited communication or collaboration. Silos often lead to inefficiencies, duplicated work, and integration challenges.

**Example:** Development team working separately from QA team with minimal interaction, or platform teams not coordinating with product teams

### Artifacts
Tangible byproducts produced during software development that help document, track, and manage the development process. Artifacts can be technical, process-oriented, or communication-focused.

**Example:** Requirements documents, architecture diagrams, sprint backlogs, test plans, release notes

### Agile
From the word meaning "to move quickly and easily," Agile is a mindset and set of practices that enables teams to adapt and respond rapidly to change. It emphasizes delivering value in small increments, learning from feedback, and continuously improving. Agile approaches contrast with traditional waterfall methodologies by focusing on flexibility rather than rigid planning.

**Example:** Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and hybrid approaches like the Product-Driven Agile Framework

## Methodological Concepts

### Product-Driven Agile
A framework that combines elements of traditional agile methodologies with a strong focus on product structure and team alignment. It emphasizes hierarchical work organization and clear ownership.

### Work Item Hierarchy
The structured relationship between different types of work items (Epics → Features → User Stories → Tasks) that connects strategic objectives to daily development activities.

### Synchronized Cadence
The practice of having all teams operate on the same sprint schedule to facilitate coordination, planning, and delivery.

### Living Documentation
Documentation that evolves alongside the product and serves as both a project management framework and a knowledge repository.

## Azure DevOps Specific Terms

### Work Item
The generic term for any trackable entity in Azure DevOps, including epics, features, user stories, and tasks.

### Board
A visual representation of work items that allows teams to view and manage their work in progress.

### Query
A saved search that returns a list of work items that match the specified criteria.

### Pipeline
An automated process for building, testing, and deploying code.

### Repository
A storage location for code and other project files, typically managed using Git.

## General Organizational Terms

### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
The process used to design, develop, test, and deploy software.

### Technical Debt
The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

### Cross-team Dependency
A situation where one team's work depends on work being completed by another team.

### Stakeholder
Any person or group that has an interest in a project or can affect or be affected by its outcome.
